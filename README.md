   ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Design Choices

1. Technology Stack

   - Next.js: Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities, which improve initial page load times and SEO.
   - TypeScript: Used to enhance code quality and maintainability through static typing.
   - Tailwind CSS: Selected for rapid UI development and easy customization.
   - Zustand: Picked as the state management library for its simplicity and ease of use compared to alternatives like Redux.

2. User Interface

   - Implemented a step-by-step checkout process with a visual stepper to guide users through the flow.
   - Designed responsive layouts to ensure a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
   - Integrated a dark mode toggle for improved accessibility and user preference.

3. Payment Integration

   - Integrated Cashfree for secure and versatile payment processing.
   - Implemented multiple payment options including UPI (with QR code, collect, and intent methods), credit/debit cards, and net banking.

4. Order Confirmation
   - Implemented real-time payment status checking and updates.
   - Displayed comprehensive order details for user reference.

## Implementation Challenges

1. State Management

   - Challenge: Maintaining consistent state across multiple steps of the checkout process.
   - Solution: Implemented a centralized state management using Zustand, allowing for easy access and updates to the cart and user information across components.

2. Responsive Design

   - Challenge: Ensuring a consistent and user-friendly interface across various device sizes.
   - Solution: Utilized Tailwind CSS's responsive classes and custom media queries to create adaptive layouts.

3. Payment Integration

   - Challenge: Implementing a secure and user-friendly payment process with multiple options.
   - Solution: Integrated Cashfree's API and implemented custom UI components to handle various payment methods, ensuring a smooth and flexible payment experience.

4. Form Validation

   - Challenge: Implementing robust form validation across multiple steps.
   - Solution: Utilized React Hook Form for efficient form handling and validation, providing immediate feedback to users.

5. Performance Optimization

   - Challenge: Ensuring fast page loads and smooth transitions between checkout steps.
   - Solution: Leveraged Next.js's built-in optimizations and implemented code splitting to reduce initial load times.

6. Theme Switching

   - Challenge: Implementing a seamless light/dark mode switch without disrupting the user experience.
   - Solution: Used a combination of Tailwind CSS and React context to manage theme changes dynamically.

7. Payment Status Handling
   - Challenge: Managing and displaying real-time payment status updates.
   - Solution: Implemented a polling mechanism to check payment status and update the UI accordingly, providing users with immediate feedback on their transactions.

## Conclusion

The implementation of this e-commerce checkout process focused on creating a user-friendly, responsive, and secure experience. By integrating Cashfree and leveraging modern web technologies, we've created a flexible and efficient checkout flow that supports multiple payment methods. The challenges faced during development were addressed through careful planning, appropriate technology choices, and iterative problem-solving, resulting in a robust and scalable solution for e-commerce transactions.
